Trntable is a simple extension that lets viewers request songs through spotify.
Walkthrough:
    As the Streamer:
    Configuration:
        1. For configuration, the streamer will have to connection their spotify account for the extension.
        2. Once enabled, streamers can change some settings initally.
            - They can either select to make a new playlist for taking requests or use an existing playlist from their Spotify Account.
            - They can also set the maximum number of requests that they want to allow a user to request. The limit is reset after 30mins to allow that user request songs again.
            - If streamer has bits support, they can enable bits for taking requests and they can set the bits amount for a request.
